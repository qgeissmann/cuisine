# Pouliche bread

## Pouliche starter

* Flour:  300g
* Water: 300g
* Dehydrated yeast: 3g

1. Mix all the ingredients with a fork until smooth (should just take a couple of minutes)
2. Cover with a wet towel and leave at least 12h at room temperature


## Dough

* Pouliche (see above): ~600g
* Water: 300g
* Dehydrated yeast: 3g
* Olive oil: 20g
* Flour: 600g
* Salt 18g

1. In a large bowl, mix water, yeast and pouliche -- with a fork
2. Add the olive oil
3. Put the flour on top
4. Add the salt on top of the flour (the yeast will suffer if it touches the salt directly, so we buffer with flour)
5. Knead for 15min (you should not need to add more flour or water)
6. Leave the dough to rise for around 8h at room temperature
7. Cut the dough in several loaves and knead them individually (no more than 2min)
8. Second-proof them on a board that you covered with a lot of flour
9. After 1-2h, add spread flour on the loavess, and make deep incisions (with a very sharp knife/razor blade)    
10. Put the loaves in the over (see baking detail below)

## Baking

Important points:

* The oven should be preheated above 220C (ideally 240C)
* The bread is baked on heavy stones (which increases thermal mass of the oven)
* Before putting the bread in, throw a large cup of boiling water in the bottom of the oven. This is known as "coup de buee" and results in a better bread crust
* Better results can be obtained (especially for large loaves), using the "four tombant" technique: turn-off (or down) the oven after a few minutes, so that temperature decreases slowly. This results in a nice crust because of the high temperature in the beginning, but the bread is also cooked all the way through
