ingredients:
  "pate brisee": 1 (i.e. 150g of flour)
  filling: 
    mushroom: 700g
    crème fraîche: 200g
    mature chedar: 200g
    red onions: 500g
    eggs: 3
    pepper: hint
    chilly pepper: hint
    nutmeg: hint
    parsley: hint
    salt: hint
    oil: hint
    butter: hint
  Preparation:
    - Put a bit a *butter* **and** *oil* in a -- large -- frying pan, and turn the stove on!.
    - Break *mushroom* caps in three or four parts, do the same with the stems. Chuck them on the hot pan.
    - Add *salt, *pepper* and *nutmeg*
    - Whilst mushrooms are cooking, cut *onions* radially (in π/8 chunks).
    - The mushrooms should loose a lot of water during the process. **Remove the extra water** and keep it on the side.
    - When the mushrooms start tasting wonderfully roasted, add the onions, along with the water ketp aside.
    - Cook until the onions are soft, stirring from time to time.
    - Leave the pan to cool down (I would suggest to prepare the dough meanwhile)
    - Add *grated cheese*, *crème fraîche*, *eggs* and *chilly pepper* to the cooled down preparation, and mix well.
    - Pour the mix into the  -- ideally slightly pre-cooked -- base.
    - Add a bit of *parsley* and extra *grated cheese* on the top!
  Baking:
    temperature: 180C
    time: 30min
