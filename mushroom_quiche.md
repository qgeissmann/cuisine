Quiche
----------

* Ingredients:
    * Pâte brisée (see above)
    * 700g mushroom,
    * 200g *crème fraîche*
    * 3 red onions
    * 3 eggs
    * pepper
    * chilly pepper
    * nutmeg
    * parsley
    * salt
    * oil
    * butter
* Process:
    1. Put a bit a butter **and** oil in a -- large -- frying pan, and turn the stove on!.
    2. Break mushroom caps in three or four parts, do the same with the stems. Chuck them on the hot pan
    3. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg
    4. Whilst mushrooms are cooking, cut unions radially (in π/8 chunks).
    5. The mushroom should loose a lot of water during the process. **Remove it** and keep it on the side.
    6. When the mushroom start tasting wonderfully roasted, add the onions, along with the water that was lost in 5.
    7. Cook until the onions are soft, stirring from time to time.
    8. Leave the pan to cool down (I would suggest to prepare the dough meanwhile)
    9. Add grated cheese, *crème fraîche*, eggs and -- a hint of -- chilly pepper to the cooled down preparation, and mix well.
    10. Pour the mix into the  -- ideally slightly pre-cooked -- base.
    11. Add a bit of parsley and extra grated cheese on the top!
    12. Bake at 180C for 30min
    13. enjoy!
